We're thrilled to announce our latest updates that further enhance Fiskl's capabilities as a leading multi-currency accounting platform for individuals and small businesses. This October, we're introducing two powerful new accounting reports that will revolutionize how you manage your accounts receivable and payable!

## What's New in October 2024

We're excited to share that our development team has outdone themselves this month. While some features take longer than expected, these new reports have been delivered ahead of schedule, providing you with essential tools for better financial management.

1. **Client Aging Report**: Our new [Client Aging Report](/docs/core-features/accounting/reports/client-aging-report) is a game-changer for managing your accounts receivable. This essential business tool allows you to stay on top of money owed to you and how these receivables are aging. Key features include:
   - Flexible bucket grouping (by day, week, month, or quarter)
   - Customizable number of aging buckets
   - Option to view all clients or focus on specific ones
   - Summary and detailed views for comprehensive analysis
   - Number simplification for easier reading of large amounts

   This report gives you a clear visual representation of money due from your clients, helping you prioritize collection efforts and manage cash flow more effectively.

2. **Vendor Aging Report**: Complementing the Client Aging Report, our new [Vendor Aging Report](/docs/core-features/accounting/reports/vendor-aging-report) is an indispensable tool for managing your accounts payable. This report helps you visualize and track money you owe to vendors. Key features mirror those of the Client Aging Report, including:
   - Customizable bucket grouping and number of buckets
   - Option to focus on all or specific vendors
   - Summary and detailed views
   - Number simplification feature

   Use this report to optimize your payment strategies, maintain good vendor relationships, and keep your cash flow under control.

Both of these reports are crucial for accrual accounting and provide invaluable insights for businesses of all sizes. They offer a level of customization and detail that puts you firmly in control of your financial data.

## How to Access the New Reports

To start using these powerful new tools:

1. Navigate to `Accounting > Reports` from the left menu
2. Select either "Client Aging Report" or "Vendor Aging Report"
3. Use the customization options to tailor the report to your needs
4. Export to Google Sheets or Excel for further analysis if needed

We're confident that these new reports will significantly enhance your financial management capabilities within Fiskl. As always, we're eager to hear your feedback and suggestions for how we can continue to improve our platform.
