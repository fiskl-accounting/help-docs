#### The Multi-Currency Reconciliation Challenge

As a business owner dealing with multiple currencies, you know the headache of reconciling Stripe payouts. With payments, subscriptions, refunds, and fees in various currencies, it's a complex puzzle that can leave you frustrated and potentially overpaying on taxes. But what if I told you there's now a solution that makes this process a breeze?

#### Introducing Fiskl's Enhanced Stripe Integration

We're thrilled to announce a major upgrade to our Stripe integration that will revolutionize how you handle multi-currency transactions and reconciliations. üéâ

#### Here's What You Get:

1. **Automated Account Setup**: Connect your Stripe account, and we'll automatically create the necessary accounts in your Chart of Accounts for each currency.

2. **Itemized Transaction Sorting**: Every transaction is categorized and placed in the relevant account, saving you hours of manual work.

3. **Zero-Touch Reconciliation**: For transactions originating in Fiskl, the reconciliation process is completely automated.

4. **Simplified Payout Matching**: Instead of reconciling hundreds of individual transactions, you'll only need to match the Stripe payout to your bank account.

#### The Impact: From Hours to Minutes

Imagine this scenario: You have USD and CAD bank accounts connected to Stripe. At the end of the week, you receive two payouts covering hundreds of transactions. Previously, this meant hours of painstaking reconciliation work. Now? It's just two simple internal transfers.

##### Why This Matters for Your Business

1. **Time Savings**: Reduce reconciliation time from hours to minutes.
2. **Accuracy**: Minimize human error in transaction allocation.
3. **Tax Optimization**: Ensure fees and refunds are correctly allocated, potentially reducing your tax liability.
4. **Focus on Growth**: Spend less time on administrative tasks and more on strategic business activities.
