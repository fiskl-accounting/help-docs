## Major Enhancements

### Enhanced Currency Management 
We're excited to introduce comprehensive currency rate management for our multi-currency accounting platform. You can now:
- Override official day rates for specific periods (e.g., set a custom USD/SGD rate for the entire month of January)
- Maintain full control over exchange rates while still having access to official rates
- Continue to override rates at the individual transaction level when needed

This gives you unprecedented flexibility in managing international transactions while maintaining accurate financial records.
