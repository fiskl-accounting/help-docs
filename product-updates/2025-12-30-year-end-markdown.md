As we wrap up 2024, we're taking a moment to reflect on an extraordinary year of growth, innovation, and reliability at Fiskl. Our dedication to building a powerful multi-currency accounting platform has yielded remarkable results, positioning us for an even more exciting year ahead as we continue to evolve and expand our platfrom.

## 2024: A Year of Strategic Growth

This year has been transformative for Fiskl as we solidified our standing as an AI-supported, multi-currency accounting and invoicing platform. Our unwavering commitment to delivering comprehensive financial tools to businesses globally has shaped every decision and feature weâ€™ve introduced. This momentum will carry forward into next year as we continue to innovate and empower businesses with smarter, more reliable solutions.

### Major Achievements

#### Powerful New Reports

We introduced several significant reporting capabilities this year that have transformed how our users manage their finances. These reports are designed to offer flexibility and insight, allowing users to toggle between cash and accrual accounting methods, compare performance across different periods, and switch seamlessly between Unrealized and Realized FX gain and loss views. They can be exported effortlessly to CSV, Excel, or even directly to Google Sheets, and each report can be customized to display either a detailed breakdown or a high-level summary, ensuring that businesses have the insights they need in the format that works best for them. Here's a glimpse of what's new:

- A comprehensive [General Ledger](../product-updates/2024-00-01-general-ledger.md) with advanced multi-currency support  
- Detailed [Client and Vendor Aging Reports](/product-updates/2024-7.md) for better receivables and payables management  
- [Transactions by Account](/product-updates/2024-03-02-transactions-by-account.md) reporting with triple currency view  
- [Statement of Cash Flows](/product-updates/2024-11.md) for enhanced cash management  


#### AI Innovation

The introduction of [Fi](/product-updates/2024-5.md), our AI advisor, marked a significant milestone in making accounting expertise accessible 24/7. Fi has become an invaluable resource, answering thousands of accounting questions monthly as users discover its capabilities. Recently upgraded with the latest Anthropic models, Fi provides totally private, secure assistance for both Fiskl features and general accounting concepts.

#### Enhanced Banking Integration

We've substantially improved our banking connections, including:

- Advanced [internal transfer matching](/product-updates/2024-8.md) with customizable tolerance levels
- Enhanced [Stripe integration](/product-updates/2024-05-21-stripe.md) for seamless multi-currency reconciliation
- Integration with emerging neo-banks like [WIO](/docs/Integrations/Bank-Connections/connect-wio.md)

#### Platform Reliability

We're particularly proud of our platform's reliability this year:

- Maintained an impressive 99.99% uptime
- Delivered consistent performance across our web, Android, and iOS applications
- Achieved stable operation with only minor issues throughout the year

#### Global Accessibility

Understanding the diverse needs of our global user base, we introduced:

- Regional pricing to make Fiskl more accessible in regions with weaker currencies
- Enhanced mobile experience across Android and iOS
- Improved performance for users worldwide

## Looking Ahead: 2025 Roadmap

As we enter 2025, we're excited about what's coming:

### Q1 & Q2 2025

- **Advanced Currency Management**: Early Q1 will bring enhanced control over exchange rates, including rate override capabilities for specific periods
- **Accountant-Focused Features**: Following successful partnerships with accounting firms, we're implementing specialized tools to support professional accountants

### Throughout 2025

- **Global Performance**: Continued investment in regional infrastructure to ensure faster performance worldwide
- **AI Enhancement**: Expanding Fi's capabilities and introducing new AI-powered features
