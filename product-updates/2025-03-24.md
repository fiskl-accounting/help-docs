## Major Enhancements

### Advanced Cross-Currency AR/AP Matching
We're thrilled to announce a significant upgrade to our AR/AP matching capabilities:

- **Cross-Currency Matching**: Match transactions between different currencies (e.g., USD AR to EUR payments)
- **Partial Payment Matching**: Seamlessly handle partial payments across different currencies
- **Split Payment Support**: Match multiple payments to a single AR/AP transaction, even with different currencies
- **Intelligent Default Values**: Our improved UI now sets the correct values for partial matches, requiring only review and adjustments when necessary

This powerful enhancement gives you unprecedented flexibility in managing international transactions while maintaining accurate financial records.
