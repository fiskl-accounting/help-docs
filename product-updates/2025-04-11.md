## Key Improvements in Detail

### Enhanced Invoice Management
We've significantly improved how you work with invoices by adding line item names and descriptions to text search functionality, fixing status changes from "Sent" status, and resolving tax calculation issues that affected some invoices.

### Payment Processing Improvements
Managing paid invoices is now more reliable with enhancements to the re-enabling and editing capabilities, ensuring consistent behavior after partial payments and when saving changes. We've also hidden manual payments on the invoice payment page after partial payments for cleaner presentation.

### Accounting Portal Updates
Your accounting workflow gets a boost with new links to the Accountant partner page and Partner Program platform. We've also improved the Chart of Accounts with better visualization including bank icons for financial accounts.

### Subscription Updates
We've streamlined subscription management with more intuitive subscription management options.
