## Data Migration (Definition)
Data migration is the process of transferring data between storage types, formats, or computer systems.

Key aspects of data migration include:
1. Often necessary when upgrading accounting software or changing systems
2. Involves extracting data from the source system, transforming it to fit the new system, and loading it into the target system (ETL process)
3. Requires careful planning to ensure all necessary historical financial data is transferred
4. May involve data cleaning and validation to improve data quality in the new system
5. Critical for maintaining data integrity and continuity in financial reporting
6. Can be complex, especially when moving between systems with different data structures
7. Typically requires thorough testing and verification to ensure accuracy of migrated data

Successful data migration is crucial for maintaining accurate and complete financial records when transitioning between accounting systems.
