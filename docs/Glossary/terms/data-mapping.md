## Data Mapping (Definition)
Data mapping is the process of creating data element mappings between two distinct data models.

Key aspects of data mapping include:
1. Essential when integrating data from different sources or migrating to a new system
2. Ensures that data fields in the source system correctly correspond to fields in the target system
3. Crucial for maintaining data consistency and accuracy during system changes
4. May involve data transformation to match the format or structure of the target system
5. Supports data normalization and standardization across different systems
6. Important for ensuring continuity in financial reporting during system transitions
7. Requires understanding of both source and target data structures and business rules

Effective data mapping is critical for successful data migration and integration projects in accounting and financial systems.
