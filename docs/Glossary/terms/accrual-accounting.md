# Accrual Accounting

Accrual accounting is a method of bookkeeping that records financial transactions when they are incurred, regardless of when cash changes hands. This method provides a more comprehensive view of a company's financial position by accounting for future revenues and obligations.

## Key Aspects of Accrual Accounting

1. **Revenue Recognition**: Income is recorded when earned, even if payment hasn't been received.
2. **Expense Recording**: Expenses are logged when incurred, even if they haven't been paid yet.
3. **Financial Position**: Offers a more accurate picture of a company's overall financial health.
4. **Complexity**: Generally more complex to maintain than cash accounting.
5. **Common Usage**: Required for larger businesses and public companies in many jurisdictions.
6. **Long-term Focus**: Provides a better view of long-term financial position and performance.
7. **Regulatory Compliance**: Complies with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
