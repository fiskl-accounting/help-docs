## Accrual Accounting (Definition) 

Accrual accounting is a method of accounting where revenues and expenses are recorded when they are earned or incurred, regardless of when the money is actually received or paid. This method provides a more accurate picture of a companys financial health by matching revenues with the expenses incurred to earn those revenues. 

Key features of accrual accounting include: 

1. Recognition of revenue when earned, not when cash is received 
2. Recording of expenses when incurred, not when paid 
3. Use of accounts receivable and accounts payable 
4. Provides a more accurate view of a companys financial position 
5. Required for larger businesses and public companies 
6. Complies with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) Accrual accounting is considered more complex than cash accounting but offers a more comprehensive view of a companys financial status.
