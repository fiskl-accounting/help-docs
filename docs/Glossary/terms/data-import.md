## Data Import (Definition)
Data import is the process of retrieving data from an external source and inputting it into a system.

Key aspects of data import include:
1. Allows integration of data from various sources into a central system
2. Supports migration of historical data when implementing new accounting software
3. Facilitates bulk data entry, saving time and reducing manual errors
4. Often requires data mapping to align imported data with the systems structure
5. May involve data cleansing and validation to ensure accuracy
6. Can automate regular data updates from external sources (e.g., bank feeds)
7. Requires consideration of data security and privacy during the transfer process

Efficient data import capabilities are essential for maintaining comprehensive and up-to-date financial records in modern accounting systems.
