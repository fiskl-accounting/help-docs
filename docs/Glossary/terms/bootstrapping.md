## Bootstrapping (Definition)
Bootstrapping refers to the process of starting and growing a business using only personal finances or the companys generated revenue, without relying on external funding sources such as investors or loans.

Key aspects of bootstrapping include:
1. Self-funding the business through personal savings, credit cards, or cash flow from operations
2. Minimizing expenses and maximizing efficiency to conserve resources
3. Focusing on generating revenue quickly to reinvest in the business
4. Maintaining full control and ownership of the company
5. Potentially slower growth compared to externally funded businesses
6. Developing creative solutions to challenges due to limited resources
7. Building a lean and efficient business model from the start

Bootstrapping can be a challenging but rewarding approach to building a business, offering greater independence and financial discipline.
