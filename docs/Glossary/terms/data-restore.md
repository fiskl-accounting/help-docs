## Data Restore (Definition)
Data restore is the process of copying backup data from secondary storage and restoring it to its original location or a new location.

Key aspects of data restore include:
1. Critical for recovering from data loss due to system failures, human errors, or disasters
2. Allows retrieval of historical financial data when needed
3. Essential component of business continuity and disaster recovery plans
4. May involve full system restore or selective restore of specific data
5. Requires regular testing to ensure the integrity and usability of backed-up data
6. Can be time-sensitive, especially in cases of system outages affecting operations
7. May require coordination between IT and accounting departments for successful execution

Efficient data restore capabilities are crucial for minimizing downtime and ensuring the continuity of financial operations in the event of data loss.
