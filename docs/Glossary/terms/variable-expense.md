## Variable Expense (Definition)
A variable expense is a cost that changes in proportion to the level of business activity.

Key aspects of variable expenses include:
1. Fluctuate based on production volume or sales activity
2. Examples include raw materials, sales commissions, and shipping costs
3. Increase as production or sales increase, and decrease as they decline
4. Important for break-even analysis and financial forecasting
5. Contrast with fixed expenses, which remain constant regardless of activity level
6. Understanding variable expenses is crucial for pricing decisions and cost management
7. Can be more easily adjusted in response to changes in business conditions

Effective management of variable expenses is essential for maintaining profitability and adapting to changing business environments.
