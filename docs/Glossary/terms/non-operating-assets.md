## Non-Operating Assets (Definition)
Non-operating assets are assets that are not essential to the ongoing operations of a business but may still generate income or provide a return on investment.

Key aspects of non-operating assets include:
1. Not directly related to a companys core business activities
2. Can include investments, unused land or equipment, or non-core business units
3. May generate income but are not necessary for day-to-day operations
4. Often separated from operating assets in financial analysis to assess core business performance
5. Can be sold without significantly impacting the main business operations
6. May provide diversification or strategic benefits to a company
7. Understanding non-operating assets is important for comprehensive financial analysis and strategic decision-making

Proper management of non-operating assets can contribute to a companys overall financial health and provide additional value to shareholders.
