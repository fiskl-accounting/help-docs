## Client (Definition)

In accounting and business, a Client, also known as a Customer, refers to any individual, company, or entity that purchases goods or services from a business. Clients are essential for generating revenue and sustaining business operations, as they are the recipients of the products or services offered by the company.

Within the Fiskl platform, the term "Client" is fundamental to managing invoices, quotes, and specific accounting transactions. Clients are recorded in the accounting system to track sales, issue invoices, and manage accounts receivable. Proper client management is crucial for accurate financial reporting, cash flow monitoring, and maintaining strong business relationships. By keeping detailed records of transactions with each client, businesses can efficiently manage their revenue streams and ensure compliance with accounting practices.
