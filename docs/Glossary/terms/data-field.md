2. Have defined data types (e.g., text, number, date) that determine what kind of data can be stored
3. Form the basic structure of databases and spreadsheets
4. Can have validation rules to ensure data integrity
5. May have default values or be required fields
6. Can be indexed for faster searching and sorting

Proper design and management of data fields are crucial for maintaining accurate and useful financial records.
