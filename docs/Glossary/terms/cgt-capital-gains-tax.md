## CGT - Capital Gains Tax (Definition)
Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is a tax on the profit when you sell an asset that has increased in value.

Key aspects of Capital Gains Tax include:
1. Applies to the gain (profit) made on the sale of an asset, not the total amount received
2. Common assets subject to CGT include stocks, bonds, precious metals, and property
3. Tax rates can vary depending on the type of asset and how long it was held
4. Some assets may be exempt from CGT or have special rules
5. Losses from asset sales can often be used to offset capital gains
6. Can significantly impact investment strategies and financial planning
7. Rules and rates for CGT can vary by country and may change over time

Understanding Capital Gains Tax is crucial for effective investment planning and managing tax liabilities.
