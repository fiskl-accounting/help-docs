## Liquidity (Definition)
Liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset or security can be quickly bought or sold in the market without affecting the assets price.

Key aspects of liquidity include:
1. Measures how easily assets can be converted to cash without significant loss in value
2. Higher liquidity generally means lower risk and lower returns
3. Important for meeting short-term obligations and managing cash flow
4. Can be assessed using ratios like the current ratio and quick ratio
5. Cash is the most liquid asset, followed by marketable securities
6. Lack of liquidity can lead to financial distress or bankruptcy
7. Balancing liquidity with profitability is a key financial management challenge

Understanding and managing liquidity is crucial for maintaining financial stability and operational flexibility in a business.
