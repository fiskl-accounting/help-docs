## Bad Debts (Definition)
Bad debts are amounts owed to a company that are unlikely to be paid by the customers or debtors. These are debts that the company has determined are uncollectible and must be written off.

Key points about bad debts include:
1. Result from credit sales where the customer fails to pay
2. Can significantly impact a companys cash flow and profitability
3. Are written off as an expense in the companys financial statements
4. Require the creation of an allowance for doubtful accounts to estimate potential losses
5. May be partially or fully recovered in some cases, leading to bad debt recoveries
6. Can be minimized through effective credit policies and collection procedures
7. Are treated differently for tax purposes depending on the accounting method used (cash or accrual)

Managing bad debts effectively is crucial for maintaining financial stability and accurate financial reporting.
