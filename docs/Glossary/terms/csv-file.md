5. Does not support formatting, multiple worksheets, or complex formulas like Excel files
6. Ideal for storing tabular data in a simple, readable format
7. Widely used in data analysis, database management, and data migration

CSV files are a versatile and widely-used format for storing and transferring structured data.
