2. Typically have maturities of less than one year
3. Reported as current assets on the balance sheet
4. Provide a way for companies to earn returns on excess cash
5. Can be quickly sold to meet short-term cash needs
6. Subject to market risk and interest rate risk
7. Understanding marketable securities is important for cash management and investment strategies

Effective management of marketable securities can help optimize returns on idle cash while maintaining liquidity for business operations.
