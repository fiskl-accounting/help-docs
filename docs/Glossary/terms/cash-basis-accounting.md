## Cash Basis Accounting (Definition)
Cash basis accounting is an accounting method where revenue is only recorded when cash is received, and expenses are recorded when cash is paid out.

Key aspects of cash basis accounting include:
1. Simplifies bookkeeping as it only deals with cash transactions
2. Provides a clear picture of how much cash is available at any given time
3. Commonly used by small businesses and sole proprietorships
4. May not provide an accurate view of a companys financial health in the long term
5. Not compliant with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for most businesses
6. Can lead to misleading financial statements if there are significant timing differences between transactions and cash flows
7. Not suitable for businesses with inventory or that use credit transactions

While simple to use, cash basis accounting may not provide a comprehensive view of a companys financial position.
