## Cash Accounting (Definition)
Cash accounting is a method of bookkeeping that records financial events based on cash flows and cash position.

Key aspects of cash accounting include:
1. Revenue is recorded when cash is received
2. Expenses are recorded when cash is paid out
3. Provides a clear picture of cash position at any given time
4. Simpler and easier to maintain than accrual accounting
5. Commonly used by small businesses and for personal finances
6. May not provide an accurate view of long-term financial position
7. Not compliant with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for larger businesses

Cash accounting can be useful for understanding immediate cash flow but may not reflect all outstanding obligations or expected revenues.
