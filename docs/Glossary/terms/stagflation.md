## Stagflation (Definition)
Stagflation is a situation where the inflation rate is high, the economic growth rate slows, and unemployment remains steadily high.

Key aspects of stagflation include:
1. Combination of stagnant economic growth and high inflation
2. Challenges traditional economic theories that inflation and unemployment are inversely related
3. Can be caused by supply shocks, poor economic policies, or a combination of factors
4. Difficult for policymakers to address as solutions for inflation may worsen unemployment and vice versa
5. Can lead to reduced consumer spending and business investment
6. Often results in decreased corporate profits and stock market performance
7. Understanding stagflation is important for businesses to adapt strategies during challenging economic periods

Recognizing and preparing for stagflation can help businesses mitigate its negative effects on operations and profitability.
