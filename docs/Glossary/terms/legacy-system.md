## Legacy System (Definition)
A legacy system is an old method, technology, computer system, or application program that continues to be used, typically because it still functions for the users needs.

Key aspects of legacy systems include:
1. Often critical to day-to-day operations despite being outdated
2. May be difficult or expensive to replace or update
3. Can pose security risks due to lack of modern safeguards
4. May be incompatible with newer systems, causing integration challenges
5. Often require specialized knowledge to maintain, as skills become scarce
6. Can be costly to maintain due to lack of vendor support or replacement parts
7. Gradual migration or replacement is often necessary to modernize business operations

Understanding and managing legacy systems is crucial for balancing operational needs with technological advancement in businesses.
