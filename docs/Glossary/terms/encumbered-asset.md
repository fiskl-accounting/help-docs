## Encumbered Asset (Definition)
An encumbered asset is an asset that is owned by one entity but subject to a legal claim by another.

Key aspects of encumbered assets include:
1. Often used as collateral for loans or other financial obligations
2. May have restrictions on sale, transfer, or use
3. Can affect a companys ability to obtain additional financing
4. Must be disclosed in financial statements
5. Can include real estate, equipment, accounts receivable, or securities
6. The value of the encumbrance may be less than the total value of the asset
7. Understanding encumbrances is crucial for assessing a companys true financial position

Proper management and disclosure of encumbered assets are important for maintaining transparency and accurately representing a companys financial situation.
