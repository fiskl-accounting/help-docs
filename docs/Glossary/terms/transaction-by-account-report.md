**## Transaction by Account (Definition)**
In accounting and financial reporting, a Transaction by Account report is a comprehensive financial statement that organizes and displays accounting transactions grouped by their respective general ledger accounts.

The Transaction by Account report is a detailed financial document that provides a systematic view of all transactions affecting each account in the general ledger over a specified period. This report categorizes financial activities by account, allowing for in-depth analysis of transactional data within each account category. It typically includes transaction dates, descriptions, amounts, and running balances. The report often offers various filtering and presentation options, enabling users to customize the view based on specific criteria such as date ranges, account types, or transaction categories. By presenting a granular breakdown of financial activities within each account, the Transaction by Account report serves as a valuable tool for auditing, financial analysis, and decision-making, providing insights into the detailed composition of an organization's financial position and performance.
