## Balloon Payment (Definition)
A balloon payment is a large, lump-sum payment made at the end of a loan term, often representing a significant portion of the loans principal. It is typically larger than the regular periodic payments and is used to reduce the amount of regular payments throughout the loans life.

Key aspects of balloon payments include:
1. Common in certain types of loans, such as commercial real estate or auto loans
2. Allows for lower regular payments during the loan term
3. Can be risky for borrowers if they are unable to make the large final payment
4. Often requires refinancing or selling the asset to cover the balloon payment
5. May offer lower interest rates compared to fully amortizing loans
6. Requires careful financial planning and consideration of future ability to pay
7. Can be attractive for borrowers expecting a future windfall or increase in income

Borrowers considering loans with balloon payments should carefully assess their financial situation and future prospects before committing to such an arrangement.
