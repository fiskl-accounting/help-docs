## Goodwill (Definition)
Goodwill is an intangible asset that arises when a company acquires another business for a price higher than the fair market value of its net assets.

Key aspects of goodwill include:
1. Represents the value of a companys reputation, customer base, brand name, and other intangible factors
2. Recorded on the balance sheet as a long-term asset
3. Not amortized, but subject to annual impairment tests
4. Can significantly impact a companys financial statements and ratios
5. Often a consideration in mergers and acquisitions
6. Difficult to value precisely due to its intangible nature
7. Treatment of goodwill can vary between different accounting standards (e.g., GAAP vs. IFRS)

Understanding goodwill is important for accurate business valuation and financial reporting, particularly in the context of corporate acquisitions.
