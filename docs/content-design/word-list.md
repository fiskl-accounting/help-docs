## A

### account

Lowercase unless referring to a specific product (e.g., Fiskl Account).

### accounting terms

When introducing an accounting term, define it first, then provide the technical term.

Example: "Include all of your debts, like loans and mortgages. In accounting, these are called liabilities."

### acronyms

Spell out on first use, followed by the acronym in parentheses. Use the acronym thereafter.

### AI

It's okay to use the acronym for Artificial Intelligence, but focus on benefits rather than the technology itself.

### app

Lowercase. Specify the name of the app when using this word.

Example: "The Fiskl mobile app helps you manage your business finances on the go."

## B

### bank transfer

Use "bank transfer" when referring to moving funds between bank accounts. Be specific about any fees associated with different payment types.

### business name

Use "business name" when referring to the customer's business or legal business name. Use "company name" for what the customer named their business inside Fiskl.

## C

### can, can't

Use "can" instead of "allowed to" or "enabled." Use "can't" instead of "cannot" or "can not."

### chart of accounts

Lowercase. Example: "We call this your chart of accounts."

### click

Use "select" insteadâ€”not everyone uses a mouse. Provide clear context for where a CTA will take the customer.

Example: "Select Vendors and then Bill"

### cloud

Use sparingly. Focus on actions or be specific about data location. Try phrases like "online," "on the web," or "anywhere/anytime access."

### company

Refers to what a customer sets up in Fiskl to track financial data for a business.

### customer

People who use Fiskl are our customers. You can also use "customer" when talking to a small business about their customers.

## D

### data

Use "data" or "information" when discussing privacy or sensitive topics. "Info" is okay in less formal contexts.

### default

Avoid using "default" in customer-facing copy due to negative associations.

## E

### e-commerce

Lowercase unless it starts a sentence. Hyphenate.

### email

One word, lowercase. Don't hyphenate.

## F

### Fiskl

Always capitalize "Fiskl" when referring to the product.

### free

Use caution with this word. Set accurate customer expectations. Don't capitalize or write in all caps. Use "included" instead of "free" when possible.

## G

### guarantee

Only use if approved by your legal partner. It implies a promise and may have legal implications.

## H

### help

Capitalize "Help" if referring to the UI. Lowercase when referring to getting aid.

## I

### info links

Use for brief definitions or explanations. In Fiskl, info links appear with a blue underline.

### invoice

Use as a noun. Use verbs like "send" or "create" when describing providing an invoice to a customer.

Example: "Create an invoice for your customer."

## L

### line item

Two words, not capitalized unless at the start of a sentence.

## M

### mobile device

Use "mobile device" when talking about any mobile device. You can also say "phone or tablet."

## N

### notifications

### OK

Use "OK," not "okay" or "o.k."

## P

Example: "Select Vendors and then Bill"

One word as a noun or adjective, two words as a verb.

### sign in, sign out

Use instead of "log in" or "log out."

## T

### tap

Use for touchscreen devices. Use "select" when the device is unknown.

## U

### user

Avoid using "user." Instead, use "you," "person," "people," "someone," or "customer."

### user ID

Two words. Capitalize "User ID" only as a field name.

## W

### we

Use for direct, sincere communication with the customer. Avoid sounding creepy or making the product seem like a person.

### website

One word, lowercase.

Remember: The goal is to create documentation that is easy to understand, navigate, and apply. Always consider the customer's perspective and needs when writing.
