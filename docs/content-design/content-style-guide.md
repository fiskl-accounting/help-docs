# Fiskl Documentation Style Guide

## Core Principles

1. Keep it short and scannable
2. Use less content for lighter cognitive load
3. Keep it simple to make the product appear easy to use
4. Focus on what's useful to the customer
5. Guide with structure using hierarchy and visual elements

## Tone and Voice

- Use a friendly, professional tone
- Write in active voice
- Address the reader directly using "you"
- Use contractions for a conversational feel (e.g., "don't" instead of "do not")

## Grammar and Mechanics

- Use American English spelling (e.g., "color" not "colour")
- Use serial commas (Oxford commas)
- Capitalize proper nouns, including product names (e.g., "Fiskl")
- Use sentence case for headings (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns)

## Formatting and Structure

- Use headings and subheadings to organize content
- Limit paragraphs to 3-4 sentences
- Use bullet points for lists of items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Bold key terms or important information

## Writing Guidelines

1. Be concise:
   - Eliminate unnecessary words
   - Use simple words over complex ones
   - Aim for an 8th-grade reading level

2. Be specific:
   - Use concrete examples
   - Avoid vague language

3. Use consistent terminology:
   - Maintain a glossary of terms
   - Use "line item" (two words) consistently

4. Write clear instructions:
   - Begin each step with an action verb
   - Provide one instruction per step

5. Use visuals:
   - Include screenshots or diagrams where helpful
   - Ensure all images have descriptive alt text


## Handling Complex Explanations

When dealing with complex topics or features, follow these guidelines:

1. Progressive disclosure:
   - Start with a simple, high-level explanation
   - Gradually introduce more complex details
   - Use clear signposting to guide users through different levels of complexity

2. Layered approach:
   - Layer 1: Brief overview (1-2 sentences)
   - Layer 2: Basic explanation (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Layer 3: Detailed explanation
   - Layer 4: Advanced concepts or edge cases

3. Use analogies and examples:
   - Relate complex concepts to familiar ideas
   - Provide real-world examples to illustrate points

4. Break down complex processes:
   - Use numbered steps for sequential processes
   - Use flowcharts or diagrams for non-linear processes

5. Provide context:
   - Explain why a feature or concept is important
   - Describe when and how users might encounter it

6. Use expandable sections:
   - Hide detailed explanations behind expandable UI elements
   - Allow users to choose their level of engagement with complex topics

   Example:

    <details>
        <summary>Click to expand</summary>
        [Explanation of advanced usage, edge cases, etc.]
    </details>

7. Link to related concepts:
   - Connect complex topics to related, simpler concepts
   - Provide links to prerequisite knowledge

8. Include a summary:
   - Recap key points at the end of complex explanations
   - Highlight the most important takeaways

Example structure for a complex topic:

## Summary
[Recap of key points]

## Related Topics
- [Link to Chart of Accounts]
- [Link to Financial Statements]

Remember: The goal is to make complex information accessible to users at different levels of expertise. Always consider your audience and provide clear paths for both basic understanding and deep dives into complex topics.

## Numbers and Measurements

- Spell out numbers zero through nine, use numerals for 10 and above
- Use numerals for all measurements (e.g., "3 inches", "5 GB")
- Use the "$" symbol before numbers for currency (e.g., "$10.99")

## Links and References

- Use descriptive link text (avoid "click here")
- Ensure all links are functional and relevant

Use descriptive and meaningful text for hyperlinks. This practice improves accessibility, usability, and search engine optimization. The link text should clearly indicate the destination or purpose of the link without relying on surrounding context.

        #### Why This Matters:

        1. Accessibility: Screen readers can navigate from link to link, and descriptive text helps users understand the purpose of each link.
        2. Usability: Users often scan pages for links, and descriptive text makes it easier to find relevant information.
        3. Context: Descriptive links provide context even when read out of context.
        4. SEO: Search engines use link text to understand the content of the linked page.

        Remember, the goal is to make your content as clear and navigable as possible for all users, regardless of how they're accessing your site.
