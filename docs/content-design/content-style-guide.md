# Fiskl Documentation Style Guide

## Core Principles

1. Keep it short and scannable
2. Use less content for lighter cognitive load
3. Keep it simple to make the product appear easy to use
4. Focus on what's useful to the customer
5. Guide with structure using hierarchy and visual elements

## Tone and Voice

- Use a friendly, professional tone
- Write in active voice
- Address the reader directly using "you"
- Use contractions for a conversational feel (e.g., "don't" instead of "do not")

## Grammar and Mechanics

- Use American English spelling (e.g., "color" not "colour")
- Use serial commas (Oxford commas)
- Capitalize proper nouns, including product names (e.g., "Fiskl")
- Use sentence case for headings (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns)

## Formatting and Structure

- Use headings and subheadings to organize content
- Limit paragraphs to 3-4 sentences
- Use bullet points for lists of items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Bold key terms or important information

## Writing Guidelines

1. Be concise:
   - Eliminate unnecessary words
   - Use simple words over complex ones
   - Aim for an 8th-grade reading level

2. Be specific:
   - Use concrete examples
   - Avoid vague language

3. Use consistent terminology:
   - Maintain a glossary of terms
   - Use "line item" (two words) consistently

4. Write clear instructions:
   - Begin each step with an action verb
   - Provide one instruction per step

5. Use visuals:
   - Include screenshots or diagrams where helpful
   - Ensure all images have descriptive alt text

## Numbers and Measurements

- Spell out numbers zero through nine, use numerals for 10 and above
- Use numerals for all measurements (e.g., "3 inches", "5 GB")
- Use the "$" symbol before numbers for currency (e.g., "$10.99")

## Links and References

- Use descriptive link text (avoid "click here")
- Ensure all links are functional and relevant

## Technical Terms

- Define acronyms and technical terms on first use
- Maintain consistency in capitalization of technical terms

## Accessibility

- Use clear language and avoid jargon
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for text and backgrounds

Remember: The goal is to create documentation that is easy to understand, navigate, and apply. Always consider the user's perspective and needs when writing.
