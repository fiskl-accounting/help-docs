Connecting your WIO Bank account to Fiskl Banking transforms your financial management, especially for businesses using multiple currencies. This integration simplifies the traditionally complex process of reconciling transfers between accounts, saving you time and reducing errors.

## How it works

When you connect WIO Bank to Fiskl Banking:

1. Fiskl imports all transactions from your WIO Bank account(s)
2. We create accurate ledger entries for each transaction, including:
   - Transaction amounts
   - Currency conversion rates for multi-currency transfers
3. Ledger accounts are automatically created and updated
4. Zero-touch reconciliation is performed for all account transfers, including multi-currency accounts
