Connecting your Stripe account to Fiskl Banking transforms your financial management, especially for multi-currency transactions. This integration simplifies the traditionally complex process of reconciling Stripe pay-outs, saving you time and reducing errors.

## How it works

When you connect Stripe to Fiskl Banking:

1. Fiskl imports all transactions from your Stripe account(s)
2. We create accurate ledger entries for each transaction, including:
   - Transaction amounts
   - Fees
   - Currency conversion rates
3. Ledger accounts are automatically created and updated
4. You only need to match the single Stripe pay-out to your bank account as an internal transfer

This process eliminates the need to reconcile hundreds of individual transactions, greatly simplifying your accounting workflow.

## Benefits

- **Accurate multi-currency support**: Handles transactions and conversions across different currencies
- **Comprehensive transaction handling**: Manages all Stripe transactions, including:
  - Fiskl invoices paid via Stripe
  - Transactions initiated outside Fiskl
  - Issuing card transactions
  - Fees, refunds, charges, and chargebacks
- **Automatic account creation**: Creates new balance accounts in Fiskl when new pay-out accounts are added in Stripe.
- **Multiple account support**: Connect and manage multiple Stripe accounts.
- **Cross-platform functionality**: Works seamlessly across iOS, Android, and Web.
- **Permission-based access**: Control who can view and manage Stripe transactions.

## Connecting your Stripe account

1. Go to Banking in the left menu or visit the [Banking page](https://my.fiskl.com/banking).
2. Select "Stripe" from the available options.
3. Configure sync settings:
   - Choose a start date for importing transactions
   - Decide whether to import all transactions from the selected date

:::info[caution]
Avoid selecting `ALL` transactions if possible. Consider using your current financial year's start date. We'll create an Opening Balance ledger transaction as needed. Selecting `ALL` may result in numerous unnecessary ledger entries due to the detailed nature of this feed.
:::

4. Change your categories if required:
   - Choose a category for charges (e.g., "Payment processing fees")
   - Optionally, enable "Create clients" and "Create vendors"

:::info
Enabling "Create vendors" may add many new vendors to your account.
:::

5. Connect to Stripe:
   - Log in to your existing Stripe account or create a new one
6. Verify the connection:
   - Your Stripe accounts will appear automatically in Fiskl
   - You can connect multiple Stripe accounts, including those with multiple currencies

## After connecting

- The initial download may display temporary warning icons while we calculate the balances
- To view transactions, click "Transactions" on the account card or access the matching ledger account from Fiskl Chart of Accounts

:::info
Connecting Stripe as a payment gateway is a separate process from this banking integration.

Remember to regularly review your Stripe connection to ensure accurate transaction import and categorization.
