## Tips for effective communication with Fi

To get the most out of your interactions with Fi, consider these best practices:

1. **Be specific**: Clearly state your question or concern. For example, instead of asking "How do expenses work?", try "Why don't my added expenses appear on my dashboard or in my P&L report?"

1. **Provide context**: If your question relates to a specific feature or report in Fiskl, mention it explicitly.

1. **Ask follow-up questions**: If Fi's initial response doesn't fully address your query, don't hesitate to ask for clarification or additional information.

1. **Use the feedback feature**: If an answer doesn't meet your needs, select the thumbs down icon to mark it as unhelpful. This valuable feedback helps us improve Fi's responses over time.

1. **Start fresh when changing topics**: Clear the conversation when moving to a new subject to ensure Fi's responses are tailored to your current inquiry.
