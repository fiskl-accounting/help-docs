After creating a quote in Fiskl, you have several options for sending it to your client. This guide will walk you through the process of sending quotes.

## Before you start

Ensure that you've created, saved, and reviewed the quote for accuracy before sending.

## Sending options

### Send by email

Fiskl offers two email formats for sending quotes:

#### Standard emails

HTML-formatted emails provided by Fiskl that:

- Respect the quote's language setting
- Can be customized with an email logo set in Templates and brands
- Use your quote template's primary header color for branding consistency

#### Custom emails

Create unique, company-specific messages in [Templates and brands](../../Settings-Configurations/templates-and-brands#custom-emails) for various scenarios.

Share links provide flexibility in how you send quotes. The generated link is the same one used in the "View Quote" button of emailed quote. It directs your client to a secure page where they can preview the quote and accept it. You can send this link via your own email client, messaging apps, or any other communication method you prefer.
