# Managing your quote

After creating a quote, select it to open the preview screen. You'll see how your client will view the quote on the left, and management options on the right.

## Convert to invoice

A quote that has been accepted can be converted to an invoice.

## Draft quote

For draft quote, you can:

- Configure email delivery settings
- Add attachments to be included with the invoice
- Change the associated brand

Draft quote doesn't have a shared link available.

## Sent quote

Once an quote is sent, you can view its history, manage emails and add or remove attachments.

## Editing quote

You can only edit the quote in "Draft" status directly. To edit a sent quote, set it to draft mode, make your changes, then save.

:::info[caution]
In draft mode previous share links will not work until the quote is back into sent status

## Additional actions

You can print, duplicate, or delete the quote as needed. Deletion is available from the quote list.

## Best practices for quotes

Regularly review your quote statuses and double-check changes before saving edited quote. Be cautious when changing dates on the quote with existing payments to maintain accurate records and ensure smooth transactions with your clients.
