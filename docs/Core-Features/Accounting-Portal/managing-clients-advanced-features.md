## Managing client connections

Effectively managing your client connections is at the heart of using the Fiskl Accounting Portal. This section covers the essential processes for establishing and maintaining your client relationships within the portal.

Here, you'll learn how to:

Invite new clients to connect their accounts to your portal
Accept invitations from clients who want to grant you access to their accounts
Disconnect from client accounts when necessary

These features allow you to build and manage your client network efficiently, ensuring you have the right level of access to serve your clients' needs. Let's dive into each of these processes in detail.

### Inviting clients

You can invite clients to connect their Fiskl accounts to your portal:

1. In the Accounting Portal, select "Invite"
2. Enter the client's email address
3. Click "Send"

The client will receive an email with instructions, and their account will be automatically linked to yours upon creation.

### Accepting client invitations

Clients can also invite you to access their accounts:

1. You'll receive an email invitation from Fiskl
2. A noticeable banner will appear on your portal home page
3. Review the invitation and choose to accept or reject
4. If accepted, the client's account will be connected to your portal

### Disconnecting clients

To disconnect a client:

1. Locate the client in your portal dashboard
2. Hover over the client's entry to reveal a bin icon
3. Click the bin icon and confirm that you want to disconnect the account
4. Choose "Disconnect" and confirm the action

:::note
Clients can also disconnect your access to their account at any time from their Fiskl settings.

## Accessing client accounts

To access a client's account directly from the Accounting Portal:

1. Locate the client in your list of connected clients on the portal dashboard
2. Hover over the client's entry
3. Click the "Go To" button that appears

This action will automatically sign you into the client's account, granting you admin-level access to their Fiskl environment.

### Returning to the Accounting Portal

While working in a client's account, you can easily return to the Accounting Portal:

1. Look for the "Back to Accountant" button in the left menu of the client's account
2. Click this button to immediately return to your Accounting Portal dashboard

:::tip
The "Back to Accountant" button is always visible in the left menu when you're in a client's account, ensuring you can quickly switch back to your portal at any time.
:::

Remember to exercise caution and professionalism when accessing and working within client accounts, as all actions are audited for security purposes.

## Accountant permissions and responsibilities

As an accountant connected to a client's account, you have admin-level access, which includes:

- Viewing and managing all financial data
- Creating and editing transactions
- Generating reports
- Managing settings and integrations

:::important
All actions taken within a client's account are audited for security and transparency. Exercise caution and professionalism when accessing client accounts.
