Recurring invoices offer a practical solution for freelancers and small businesses by streamlining the billing process. They help ensure timely payments, reduce manual work, and keep your finances organized, allowing you to focus more on your core business activities.

Recurring invoices in Fiskl consist of a regular invoice which serves as a template and a schedule that controls when the invoice will be created and sent. It has some other nifty features like automatically including billing items for a client. (e.g., time booked during the week that is allocated to the same client can be automatically included.)

## Creating a recurring invoice

1. Select Sales from the left menu
2. Select the plus button next to Recurring invoices

### Set up the schedule

1. Set the start date and choose the frequency
2. For custom frequencies (e.g., every two weeks), select "Custom" and enter your preferences
3. Choose when your recurring schedule will end:
   - Add an end date
   - Set it to end after a number of occurrences
   - Toggle "Never stop" for indefinite recurrence
4. Decide on auto-send options:
   - Check "Auto-send" for Fiskl to automatically create and send your invoices
   - Uncheck "Auto-send" for Fiskl to create the invoice and notify you when it's ready to send
5. To include unbilled items (e.g., Time, Mileage, or Expenses), check the unbilled items option and select the required items
