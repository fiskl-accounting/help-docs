Access your recurring invoice list by selecting Sales > Recurring invoices from the left menu.

:::info[note]
Invoices created by a recurring invoice schedule appear in both the regular invoice list and the recurring invoice list. They function like regular invoices, with the added ability to view all invoices from the same schedule.

## Available actions

- **Edit**: Modify your recurring invoice template or schedule
- **Pause**: Temporarily stop future invoices from being created and sent
- **End**: Stop all future invoices and delete the recurring template
- **View related invoices**: See all invoices associated with the recurring template

## Editing a recurring invoice

To edit a recurring invoice template or schedule:

1. Navigate to Sales > Recurring invoices
2. Select "Pause" on the invoice you want to edit
3. Select the edit button
4. Make your changes to the template, schedule, or both
5. Select "Start" to reactivate the recurring invoice

:::info[note]
You must restart the recurring invoice after editing. This applies whether you've changed the template, the schedule, or both.
:::

## Ending the recurring invoice

To end a recurring invoice:

1. Navigate to Sales > Recurring invoices
2. Select "End" on the invoice you want to terminate

This action removes the invoice template and schedule but doesn't affect any invoices already created.

:::info[note]
You can still view all invoices created by a recurring invoice schedule after it has ended by selecting the "Scheduled" option in the regular invoice list.

Remember to regularly review your recurring invoices to ensure they remain accurate and up-to-date with your business needs.
