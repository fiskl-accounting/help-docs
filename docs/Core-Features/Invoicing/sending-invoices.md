## Sending Options

There are multiple methods to sending invoices.

### Send by Email

Fiskl offers two types of email formats for sending invoices:

#### Standard Emails

Standard emails are HTML-formatted and provided by Fiskl. They offer the following features:

- Respect the language setting of the invoice
- Can be customized with a specific email logo set in Templates and Brands
- Use the primary header color from your invoice template for branding consistency

#### Custom Emails

Custom emails allow you to create unique, company-specific messages. You can set these up in [Templates and Brands](../../Settings-Configurations/templates-and-brands#custom-emails) for various scenarios, such as:

- Overdue reminders
- Deposit requests
- Invoice delivery

Custom emails provide you with special templates to give you control over the tone and content of your automated communications.

It directs your client to a secure page where they can preview the invoice and make a payment. You can send this link via your own email client, messaging apps, or any other communication method you prefer.
