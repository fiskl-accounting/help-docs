Once you've created an invoice in Fiskl, you have several options for sending it to your client. This guide will walk you through the process of sending invoices and setting up automated reminders.

## Before sending

Ensure that:

1. You've reviewed the invoice for accuracy
1. You've selected the appropriate payment methods

For details on creating invoices, refer to the [Create invoices](./creating-invoices.md) section of this guide.

## Sending options

There are multiple methods to sending invoices.

### Send by Email

Fiskl offers two types of email formats for sending invoices:

#### Standard emails

Standard emails are HTML-formatted and provided by Fiskl. They offer the following features:

- Respect the language setting of the invoice
- Can be customized with a specific email logo set in Templates and Brands
- Use the primary header color from your invoice template for branding consistency

#### Custom emails

Custom emails allow you to create unique, company-specific messages. You can set these up in [Templates and Brands](../../Settings-Configurations/templates-and-brands#custom-emails) for various scenarios, such as:

- Overdue reminders
- Deposit requests
- Invoice delivery

Custom emails provide you with special templates to give you control over the tone and content of your automated communications.

### Send share Link

Share links provide flexibility in how you send invoices. The generated link is the same one used in the "Pay Now" button of emailed invoices. It directs your client to a secure page where they can preview the invoice and make a payment. You can send this link via your own email client, messaging apps, or any other communication method you prefer.
