# Managing your invoice

After creating an invoice, select it to open the preview screen. You'll see how your client will view the invoice on the left, and management options on the right.

## Draft invoices

For draft invoices, you can:

- Configure email delivery settings
- Verify, update, or create payment methods
- Add attachments to be included with the invoice
- Change the associated brand

Draft invoices don't have a shared link available.

## Sent invoices

Once an invoice is sent, you can view its history, track payments, manage payment methods, and add or remove attachments.

## Editing invoices

You can only edit invoices in "Draft" status directly. To edit a sent invoice, set it to draft mode or select the pen icon, make your changes, then save.

:::info[caution]
Editing a sent invoice temporarily disables existing payments. These are usually restored when you save, unless you change invoice dates so that payment dates are before the invoice date. This can potentially trigger overdue reminders.

## Additional actions

You can print, duplicate, or delete invoices as needed. Deletion is available from the invoice list.

## Best practices

Regularly review your invoice statuses and double-check changes before saving edited invoices. Be cautious when changing dates on invoices with existing payments to maintain accurate records and ensure smooth transactions with your clients.
