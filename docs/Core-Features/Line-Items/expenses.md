Expenses in Fiskl represent costs incurred in running your business. They play a crucial role in financial management, offering flexibility in how they're created, tracked, and utilized within the platform.

## Understanding Expenses in Fiskl

Unlike products or services, expenses in Fiskl are standalone line items. They have unique properties that allow for versatile use across different aspects of your financial management.

Key features of expenses:

- Can be created independently or through accounting transactions*
- Attachable to invoices for client billing
- Capable of storing multiple images (e.g., receipts)
- Can be matched and reconciled in accounting
- Can be added via Fiskl mobile applications using OCR

:::info[note]
Expenses added in ledger accounts as accounting transactions only create an expense item in `Purchases > Expenses` if they are assigned a client.

## Creating Expenses

You can create expenses in several ways:

1. **Web Dashboard**: Manually enter expense details
1. **Mobile App**: Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract information from receipts
1. **Accounting Transactions**: Categorize a transaction as an expense during reconciliation

Use the mobile app's OCR feature to quickly capture and record expenses while on the go.

## Expense Components

An expense in Fiskl typically includes:

1. **Amount**: The cost of the expense
2. **Category**: The type of expense (e.g., Travel, Office Supplies)
3. **Date**: When the expense occurred
4. **Description**: Details about the expense
5. **Images**: Attached receipts or other relevant documents
6. **Client**: If the expense is billable (optional)
7. **Vendor**: The provider of the good or service (optional)

## Billable Expenses

Expenses become billable in two ways:

1. Assign a client when creating the expense
2. Add the expense to an invoice (it automatically becomes billable to that invoice's client)

Once an expense is added to an invoice, it's no longer available to add to other invoices.

## Expenses in Accounting

Expenses play a dual role in Fiskl's accounting features:

1. **Standalone Expenses**: Created independently and later reconciled
2. **Transaction-Based Expenses**: Categorized directly from bank transactions

You can attach images, assign clients and vendors, and add details to both types of expenses during the reconciliation process.

## When to Use Standalone Expenses

Standalone expenses are particularly useful in these scenarios:

1. **On-the-Go Capture**: Quickly record expenses with your mobile device, adding details like meeting attendees or purpose
2. **Team Member Submissions**: Allow team members with limited permissions to submit expenses for later reconciliation
3. **Client Billing**: Create billable expenses to attach to client invoices

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Categorization**: Use clear, consistent categories for easy reporting and analysis
2. **Timely Recording**: Record expenses as soon as possible to ensure accuracy
3. **Detailed Descriptions**: Include relevant information in the description field for future reference
4. **Image Quality**: Ensure attached receipt images are clear and legible
5. **Regular Reconciliation**: Regularly match and reconcile expenses with your accounting transactions

Remember, effective expense management in Fiskl contributes to accurate financial reporting, smoother client billing, and better overall financial health for your business.
