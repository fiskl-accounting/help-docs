Time tracking in Fiskl allows you to record and bill for the time spent on client projects or tasks. This feature is crucial for service-based businesses and professionals who bill by the hour.

## Understanding time in Fiskl

In Fiskl, time entries are standalone line items that represent periods of work. They can be created independently and later added to invoices for client billing.

Key features of time tracking:

- Multiple methods for time entry
- Customizable hourly rates
- Ability to round up time automatically
- Available on both web dashboard and mobile app
- Custom name templates

## Time entry methods

Fiskl offers three ways to track time:

1. **Timer**:
   - Start and stop a timer as you work
   - Option to round up to the nearest 5-minute mark (useful for lawyers)

2. **Manual entry**:
   - Add time directly as hours and minutes (e.g., 5h 30m)

3. **Start and end time**:
   - Enter the start and end times of your work session
   - Fiskl automatically calculates the duration

## Time entry components

A time entry in Fiskl typically includes:

1. **Duration**: The amount of time worked
2. **Rate**: The hourly rate for the work
3. **Date**: When the work was performed
4. **Description**: Details about the task or project
5. **Client**: The client for whom the work was done (for billable time)

## Billable vs. Non-billable Time

Time entries can be marked as billable or non-billable:

- **Billable**: Can be added to client invoices
- **Non-billable**: Used for internal tracking and productivity analysis

When you add a time entry to an invoice, it automatically becomes billable to that invoice's client.

## Time tracking on mobile

The Fiskl mobile app allows you to track time on the go, offering all the features available on the web dashboard:

- Start and stop timers
- Enter time manually
- Record start and end times

This ensures you can accurately track your time regardless of where you're working.

## Rounding time

For certain professions, like legal, Fiskl offers the option to automatically round up time entries:

- Round pre-sets include `3`, `5`, `10`, `15` and `30` minutes
- Helps standardize billing practices

## Custom name templates

You can configure a custom name template in [Company settings](../../Settings-Configurations/company-settings#time-name-template)

## Best practices for time tracking

1. **Be consistent**: Develop a habit of tracking time regularly for accurate billing and productivity analysis
2. **Use descriptive entries**: Provide clear descriptions for each time entry to justify billing and help with future reference
3. **Set appropriate rates**: Ensure your hourly rates are up-to-date and reflect the value of your work
4. **Regular review**: Periodically review your time entries to ensure all billable time is invoiced
5. **Utilize projects**: Use project or task categorizations to better organize and analyze your time usage

Remember, effective time tracking in Fiskl not only ensures accurate client billing but also provides valuable insights into your productivity and profitability.
