## Mileage entry components

A mileage entry in Fiskl typically includes:

1. **Distance**: The miles or kilometers traveled
2. **Rate**: The per-mile or per-kilometer rate
3. **Date**: When the travel occurred
4. **Description**: Details about the trip or purpose
5. **Client**: The client for whom the travel was done (for billable mileage)
6. **Images**: Optional attachments (e.g., odometer readings)

## Billable vs. non-billable mileage

Mileage entries can be marked as billable or non-billable:

## Best practices for mileage tracking

1. **Be consistent**: Develop a habit of recording mileage immediately after trips for accuracy
2. **Use descriptive entries**: Provide clear descriptions for each mileage entry to justify billing and help with tax reporting
3. **Keep rate updated**: Ensure your mileage rate is up-to-date and complies with relevant tax regulations
4. **Utilize images**: Attach images of odometer readings for trips where exact mileage is crucial
5. **Regular review**: Periodically review your mileage entries to ensure all billable travel is invoiced

Remember, effective mileage tracking in Fiskl not only ensures accurate client billing but also helps maintain proper records for tax purposes and business expense analysis.
