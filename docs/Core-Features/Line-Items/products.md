Products in Fiskl refer to tangible items that your business sells. Managing these items effectively is crucial for invoicing, cost management, and profitability analysis.

## Understanding products in Fiskl

In Fiskl, products serve as templates for line items on your invoices. When you add a product to an invoice, it creates a copy of the product as a line item, allowing you to adjust quantities and other details specific to that sale.

## Product components

Each product in Fiskl contains the following information:

1. **Name**: The name of the product
2. **Unit**: The unit of measurement (e.g., boxes, pallets)
3. **Amount**: Product unit price
4. **Account**: The accounting account it's assigned to (e.g., "Sales of Products")
5. **Tax**: Associated tax rate or the option to create a new one
6. **Description**: Detailed description of the product
7. **Attachments**: Option to upload multiple files (png, jpg, pdf)

## Creating a product

To create a new product:

1. Navigate to the Products & Services on the left menu
2. Select the plus icon or "New Products/Services"
3. Fill in the required fields:
   - Name
   - Unit
   - Amount
   - Tax (if applicable)
4. Add a description
5. Upload any relevant files by dragging and dropping or selecting from your computer

## Using products in invoices

Products can be added to invoices in three ways:

1. **From the product page**:
   - Select the product
   - Choose "Add to new invoice" or "Add to existing invoice"

1. **From the invoice**:
   - When creating or editing an invoice, select existing items and select a product
   - Choose the product from your list

1. **Inline in the invoice**:
   - When creating an invoice you add an inline product
   - A product template will be created along with its product line item
   - You can also select an existing product inline by typing and selecting matching products

When added to an invoice, the product becomes a line item with additional fields:

- Quantity: The number of units sold
- Unit Price: The price per unit (can be adjusted if needed)
- Total: Automatically calculated based on quantity and unit price

Remember, changes made to a product line item on an invoice do not affect the original product template.

## Managing products

Regularly review and update your products to ensure accuracy in pricing, descriptions, and associated accounts. This practice helps maintain the integrity of your invoicing and financial reporting.

Changes to the product will not affect any of its generated line items.

## Best practices for products

1. **Consistent naming**: Use clear, consistent names for your products to make them easy to find and use
2. **Regular updates**: Keep product information up-to-date, especially pricing and tax rates
3. **Use attachments**: Utilize the file attachment feature to include product images or specification sheets
4. **Account assignment**: Ensure products are assigned to the correct accounting accounts for accurate financial reporting

Remember, well-managed product information in Fiskl contributes to smoother invoicing processes and more accurate financial records.
