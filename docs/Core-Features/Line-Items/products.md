Products in Fiskl refer to tangible items that your business sells. Managing these items effectively is crucial for invoicing, cost management, and profitability analysis.

## Understanding Products in Fiskl

In Fiskl, products serve as templates for line items on your invoices. When you add a product to an invoice, it creates a copy of the product as a line item, allowing you to adjust quantities and other details specific to that sale.

## Product Components

Each product in Fiskl contains the following information:

1. **Name**: The name of the product
2. **Unit**: The unit of measurement (e.g., boxes, pallets)
3. **Amount**: The accounting account it's assigned to (e.g., "Sales of Products")
4. **Tax**: Associated tax rate or the option to create a new one
5. **Description**: Detailed description of the product
6. **Attachments**: Option to upload multiple files (png, jpg, pdf)

## Creating a Product

To create a new product:

1. Navigate to the Products & Services on the left menu
2. Select the plus icon or "New Products/Services"
3. Fill in the required fields:
   - Name
   - Unit
   - Amount
   - Tax (if applicable)
4. Add a description
5. Upload any relevant files by dragging and dropping or selecting from your computer

## Using Products in Invoices

Products can be added to invoices in three ways:

1. **From the Product Page**:
   - Select the product
   - Choose "Add to New Invoice" or "Add to Existing Invoice"

1. **From the Invoice**:
   - When creating or editing an invoice, select existing items and select a product
   - Choose the product from your list

1. **Inline in the Invoice**:
   - When creating an invoice you add an inline product
   - A product template will be created along with its product line item
   - You can also select an existing product inline by typing and selecting matching products

When added to an invoice, the product becomes a line item with additional fields:

- Quantity: The number of units sold
- Unit Price: The price per unit (can be adjusted if needed)
- Total: Automatically calculated based on quantity and unit price

Remember, changes made to a product line item on an invoice do not affect the original product template.

## Managing Products

Regularly review and update your products to ensure accuracy in pricing, descriptions, and associated accounts. This practice helps maintain the integrity of your invoicing and financial reporting.

4. **Account Assignment**: Ensure products are assigned to the correct accounting accounts for accurate financial reporting

Remember, well-managed product information in Fiskl contributes to smoother invoicing processes and more accurate financial records.
