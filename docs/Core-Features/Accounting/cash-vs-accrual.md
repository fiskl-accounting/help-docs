### Cash accounting

Cash accounting is straightforward: you record income when you receive payment and expenses when you pay them.

**Example**:

- You invoice a client on March 1st for $1000
- The client pays on April 15th
- In cash accounting, you record $1000 income in April

### Accrual accounting

Accrual accounting records income when it's earned and expenses when they're incurred, regardless of when money changes hands.

**Example**:

- You invoice a client on March 1st for $1000
- The client pays on April 15th
- In accrual accounting, you record $1000 income in March

## Key differences

1. **Timing**: Cash accounting focuses on immediate cash flow, while accrual accounting focuses on when value is exchanged

2. **Complexity**: Cash accounting is simpler, while accrual accounting requires more detailed record-keeping

3. **Financial picture**: Accrual accounting often provides a more accurate long-term view of business performance

## Benefits of each method
