If there are differences between your bank statement and Fiskl records, these are easily identified and you can resolve all discrepancies systematically - and handle multiple corrections in bulk.

## Common Types of Discrepancies

In your reconciliation, you'll encounter several types of discrepancies:

**Missing transactions in Fiskl:** Transactions accidentally removed in Fiskl or not yet in the bank feed
**Duplicate transactions:** Fiskl transactions recorded twice or duplicated in the bank feed
**Incorrect amounts:** Sometimes, transactions may be entered with different values in Fiskl and your bank statement. This often happens when amounts are added manually and don't match across both systems
**Incorrect dates:** This often happens when transactions are added manually or manually imported with wrong dates

##Missing Transactions in Fiskl##

These are transactions that appear on your bank statement but aren't recorded in Fiskl:
- Bank fees or charges
- Interest payments or earnings
- Automatic payments or deposits
- Wire transfer fees
- Currency conversion fees

##Add Missing Transactions to Fiskl##

1. Click on the "plus" next to the bank statement transaction for a new transaction to be created
2. Add the category and any other useful information
3. Click "Create" - this will add your transaction to the reconciliation
4. Tick both transactions to complete the reconciliation

##Transactions Recorded in Fiskl but Not Yet Reflected on Your Bank Statement##

These include:
- Checks issued but not yet cashed
- Pending electronic transfers
- Deposits in transit
- Outstanding payments

**Resolution:** Leave these transactions unmarked during reconciliation as they represent timing differences.

##Incorrect Transaction Amounts##

Transactions that exist in both places but with different amounts:

- Data entry errors
- Currency conversion discrepancies
- Partial payments accidentally recorded as full payments

**Resolution:** Correct the transaction amount in Fiskl by clicking on the "edit" icon to amend the Fiskl transaction, or create adjustment entries.

##Steps for Resolving Discrepancies##

1. **Identify the Difference:** Fiskl automatically displays the difference in amounts
2. **Resolve Missing Transactions:**
3. Add or remove the transactions in Fiskl by clicking on the minus/plus button above the Fiskl transactions on the left
4. Add bank fees, charges, or other missing items to Fiskl
5. Ensure correct dates and amounts
6. **Handle Timing Differences:**
7. Leave outstanding checks and deposits unmarked
8. These will appear in your next reconciliation period


**Correct Errors:**
1. Edit incorrect transaction amounts in Fiskl
2. Create reversing entries for duplicate transactions
3. Add missing transaction details or descriptions (optional)
4. **Complete Reconciliation:** Finalize the reconciliation once all discrepancies are resolved by clicking on Reconcile
