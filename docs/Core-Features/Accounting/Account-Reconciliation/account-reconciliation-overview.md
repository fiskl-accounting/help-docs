Account reconciliation is the process of comparing your bank or financial institution statements with the transactions recorded in Fiskl to ensure they match perfectly, regardless of reconciliation.
Reconciliation verifies that every transaction in your Fiskl account corresponds to an actual transaction on your bank statement, and vice versa. This automated process helps identify discrepancies, errors, or missing transactions that could affect your financial accuracy.
