# Opening Balances in Fiskl

## What are Opening Balances?

An opening balance is the initial amount in an account at the start of a financial period. It's the starting point for recording all financial activities during that period, such as sales, purchases, expenses, and payments.

Opening balances are crucial for:

- Starting a new accounting period
- Maintaining financial continuity
- Preparing accurate financial statements
- Analyzing business performance
- Ensuring compliance with accounting standards
- Facilitating audits
- Valuing your business
- Aiding in forecasting and planning

In Fiskl, you can add opening balances to any account except Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable.

## Creating Opening Balances

For connected bank accounts, Fiskl automatically adds the opening balance as a transaction. For other accounts, follow these steps:

1. From the left menu, go to "Transactions" and select your account.
2. Choose the "+IN" or "-OUT" button to create a new transaction.
3. Add the transaction name (e.g., "Opening Balance").
4. Select "Opening Balance" from the category list.
5. Enter the amount.
6. Click "Create" to save the transaction.

Your opening balance will appear in the transaction list for the selected account and in the Opening Balance account list.

For Accounts Receivable or Accounts Payable, create normal invoices or bills instead of opening balances. This allows you to:

- Match them to payments in your bank account
- Follow up on unpaid invoices easily through Fiskl

## Viewing Opening Balance Transactions

To view all opening balance transactions:

1. Go to "Transactions" in the left menu.
2. Select "Opening Balance" from the list of accounts.
3. Use filters to view transactions for specific periods.

## Verifying Opening Balances

When moving from a different accounting system to Fiskl, follow these steps:

1. Enter opening balances for all your accounts.
2. Check the ending balance of the Opening Balance account.
3. Ensure this balance equals zero.

A zero balance confirms you've entered all balances correctly and completely.
