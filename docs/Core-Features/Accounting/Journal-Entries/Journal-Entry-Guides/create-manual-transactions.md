This guide will show you how to create a manual `journal entry` also referred to as an `account transaction`.

## Common reasons for creating manual transactions

Businesses are complex and not everything is automated. Here are just two examples of why you would create a manual transaction:

1. **Cash purchases**: When you buy office supplies with petty cash, you'll need to record this to update your 'Cash on Hand' and 'Office Supplies' expense account
2. **Future payments**: If you receive inventory now but pay later, you'll want to record this upcoming expense in 'Accounts Payable' for accurate budgeting

1. Recording cash transactions - Essential for keeping an accurate record of cash flows that aren't processed through electronic means, such as petty cash expenses
2. Adjusting entries at month-end or year-end - Crucial for ensuring financial statements reflect the correct revenues and expenses within the appropriate accounting period
3. Depreciation of assets - Important for reflecting the consumption of the economic benefits of fixed assets over their useful lives
4. Accruals for unpaid expenses or unearned revenue - Necessary for compliance with the accrual basis of accounting, ensuring expenses and revenues are matched to the period in which they are incurred or earned, regardless of cash movement
5. Recording non-monetary transactions like bartering - Important for capturing the exchange of goods or services where no cash is involved, affecting the financial position and performance of the business
6. Correcting errors in previously recorded transactions - Critical for maintaining the integrity and accuracy of accounting records
7. Creating Opening and Closing balances - Fundamental for starting new accounting periods correctly and closing out the books at period end

1. Navigate using the left menu to `Accounting > Chart of Accounts`
1. Choose `Assets > Cash & Cash Equivalents` to expand and see all of its accounts (As the business owner you would typically be adding journal entries directly to their accounts in `Cash & Cash Equivalents` and `Credit Cards`)
1. Select the account you are adding the transaction to
1. Choose if you want to debit or credit the account. When working from what we term the `money accounts` it can be useful to use the IN/OUT notion of money flowing into or out of the account
1. Enter a name for your transaction
1. Assign a category by selecting an available category from the category selector
1. You can add a tax, create a new tax or leave empty if there was no tax
1. Enter the transaction amount
1. Select client and vendor if this transaction is associated with either or both
1. Click on the # icon to add a reference number if needed
1. To add an attachment, click on the paperclip icon
1. Click "Create" to save your transaction

</details>

Your transaction will appear in your account and your balance will change. The transaction will also be saved in the selected category account.

### Multi-currency transactions

Fiskl offers two ways to record foreign currency transactions:

1. In any `Cash and Cash Equivalent` account, you can record the transaction directly by choosing a category in either foreign or base currency
1. You can open a foreign currency `Cash or Cash Equivalent` account and input the transaction amount in that specific foreign currency

To record in a different currency:

1. Follow steps 1-4 from the instructions above
1. Click on "Record in different currency?"
1. Select the required currency
1. Enter the foreign currency amount. The exchange rate will be displayed automatically or can be adjusted if necessary
1. Complete the remaining details as in the standard instructions
1. Click "Create" to save your transaction

Your transaction will appear in your account, displaying both the foreign and base currencies.

Remember, keeping accurate manual entries ensures your financial reports are always up-to-date and reliable.
