## Overview

Fiskl provides powerful tools to help you manage your accounting transactions. At the top of each transaction list, you'll find two key features:

1. Filtering
2. Exporting

These tools allow you to quickly find the transactions you need and export your data for further analysis or reporting.

## Filtering transactions

Filtering helps you narrow down your transaction list to find exactly what you're looking for. You can filter by:

- Date range
- Predefined date periods (e.g., this financial year)
- Category
- Text search

To apply filters:

1. From your Chart of Accounts, select the account
2. Click on the "Filter" button at the top of the transaction list
3. Select your desired filters from the available options
4. Click "Apply" to see your filtered results

:::tip
Use text filters to search for specific vendors, invoice numbers, or transaction descriptions.
