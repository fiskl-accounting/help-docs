# How to match transaction(s) in different currencies

The process is exactly the same as a regular match. The only difference is we are selecting some multiple transactions.

## What is transaction splitting?

Splitting allows you to divide a single transaction into multiple parts, assigning each to different accounts or categories. This is useful for accurately recording complex expenses or income.


<details>
  <summary>See an example of a real world split transaction</summary>

Imagine you're a freelance marketing consultant who attends a professional conference. You pay a single fee of $1,500 for the event, but this fee covers multiple aspects of your business expenses.

Here's how you might split this transaction:

  ```
    $800 for Conference registration (Expense > Operating Expenses > Education and Training)
    $400 for workshop materials (Expenses > Operating Expenses > Office Supplies)
    $300 for included accommodation (Expenses > Operating Expenses > Travel - Accommodation)
  ```

This split allows you to accurately categorize your expenses for both accounting and tax purposes. It provides a clearer picture of how you're investing in different aspects of your business:

The conference registration fee is a direct professional development expense.
The workshop materials are office supplies that you'll use beyond the conference.
The accommodation portion could be considered a travel expense.

By splitting the transaction this way, you can:

More accurately track different types of business expenses
Better understand where your professional development budget is being allocated
Potentially claim different tax deductions based on expense categories
Gain insights into the cost breakdown of attending professional events

<details>
<summary>Tips for effective splitting</summary>

- If the sum of the splits don't balance you will see the difference. Selecting the difference will add a new split line with this amount
- Use meaningful descriptions and attach supporting files and images
- Remember making changes are just as easy, open the transaction and edit
