Accounts Payable in Fiskl is used to record future payments that you owe to vendors and suppliers (accrual accounting). For payments that have already occurred, use Operating Expenses or other relevant Expenses accounts.

## Viewing and Managing Accounts Payable Entries

After creating Accounts Payable entries:

- They will be saved in the Accounts Payable section.
- Entries will also be displayed in their corresponding expense categories (e.g., Internet & Phone, Office Equipment).
- For split entries, you can view the transactions in each of the relevant accounts.

Remember, Accounts Payable entries represent future payments. When you actually pay these bills, you'll need to record the payment separately to reduce your Accounts Payable balance.

By effectively managing your Accounts Payable in Fiskl, you can keep track of your upcoming expenses, manage your cash flow more efficiently, and maintain accurate financial records for your business.
