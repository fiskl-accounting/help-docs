## Key components of the Statement of Accounts report

Understanding the main elements of your Statement of Accounts can help you better manage your client relationships and cash flow:

1. **Invoice records**: Detailed list of sales transactions, including dates, descriptions, and amounts
2. **Payment records**: Information about payments received from the client
3. **Outstanding balances**: Any unpaid amounts owed by the client
4. **Accounts Receivables**: Any non-invoice accounts receivable amounts

Fiskl's Statement of Accounts report uniquely breaks down the Opening and Closing balance into individual currency amounts if you deal with your client in multiple currency payments. It also separates each section into their respective currency amounts (e.g., Invoices in USD, Invoices in EUR).
