# Journal Entries in Fiskl

## What are Journal Entries?

Journal entries are the foundation of your accounting system. They record all financial transactions in your business, ensuring your books are accurate and up-to-date. In Fiskl, journal entries are created automatically for most transactions, making accounting simpler for non-accountants.

## How Fiskl Handles Journal Entries

Fiskl uses a modern, double-entry accounting system that's fully multi-currency. Here's how it works:

1. **Automatic Creation**: Most journal entries are created automatically when you record transactions like sales, purchases, or bank transfers
1. **Multi-Currency Support**: Fiskl handles transactions in multiple currencies, automatically calculating exchange rates and maintaining separate balances for each currency
1. **Real-Time Updates**: Your financial reports are updated in real-time as journal entries are created or modified
1. **Mobile Access**: You can view and manage journal entries from both the web interface and mobile app

## Types of Journal Entries in Fiskl

Fiskl supports several types of journal entries to cover all your accounting needs:

1. **Standard Entries**: For regular income and expense transactions.
2. **Split Transactions**: When a single transaction affects multiple accounts.
3. **Matched Transactions**: For reconciling bank statements with your records.
4. **Internal Transfers**: For moving money between your own accounts.
5. **Multi-Currency Transactions**: For dealing with foreign currency transactions.
6. **Opening/Closing Balances**: To set up your initial account balances when starting with Fiskl.

## Creating and Managing Journal Entries

1. Go to the `Accounting > Chart of Accounts` in the left menu
1. Select the appropriate account
1. Click on `+IN` or `-OUT`
    1. For accountants the buttons also have `Debit` and `Credit` 
1. Fill in the transaction details.
1. Fiskl will automatically create the corresponding journal entry.

When adding or viewing a transaction we add a `CR` or `DR` under the category. This also has a very useful tool tip explaining which account is being credited and which is being debited.
