### Is there a minimum subscription period?

There is no contract commitment, and you can cancel at any time from the web dashboard or mobile apps. Subscriptions are billed monthly with yearly available on request. Additional users over the plan's included users are billed monthly on the same day as your monthly bill date.

### Can I change my Fiskl plan later?

Yes you can upgrade immediately to a new plan and downgrade which will come into effect at the end of your currently period. [Plans and Billing](/docs/category/plans-and-billing)

### I want to pay for my Fiskl subscription using a USA debit card but it won't allow me to as I am based in the UK?

For tax reasons you have to use a card local to your region.

### I have an offer code, how do I apply it?

The easiest way to apply an offer is at the time of registration via the provided URL but there are other methods detailed in [Offer Codes](../Plans-Billing/apply-offer-or-partner-code.md)

### How do I change my base currency?

You can not change your base or default currency once the account has been created. There are technical reasons for this related to the exchange rates stored against each transaction.

### Can I migrate my data into Fiskl?

We currently do not have dedicated migration imports from other major platforms although we are planning these. We do have imports for Clients, Expenses, Banking Transactions

### Does Fiskl provide an API link?

Our APIs are available only to partners on a contractual basis. If you have a proposal in mind, please email sales@fiskl.com.

## Account management

### How can I set up a custom domain so that all emails to my clients are sent from my email account?

Yes, provided you own the domain and can add the necessary CNAME records. [Custom Domain](../Settings-Configurations/invoice-and-quote-settings.md#custom-domain)

### How do I invite a team member, and what access permissions are available?

You can manage team members from your left menu [Team Members Tutorial](/docs/tutorials/account/invite-team-members)

Learn more [Team Management](../Settings-Configurations/user-management.md)

### How can I change the date format, e.g., from UK, 31/1/24 to US, 01/31/24?

The format of the dates and numbers are decided by using the Region and Language set in your [User Settings Preferences](https://my.fiskl.com/user-settings/preferences)

1. Go to `User Settings` > top right menu
1. Select `Preferences`
1. Here you can change the `Region` and `Language`

### How do I manage multiple companies in Fiskl?

Fiskl operates on a single company per account basis, with each company requiring its own subscription. While our [Multiple Brands](/docs/Settings-Configurations/templates-and-brands) feature allows you to create different branding for a single accounting entity, this is different from managing separate companies with their own accounting.

To manage multiple distinct companies, you can use our [Accountant Portal](/docs/Core-Features/Accounting-Portal/getting-started-accounting-portal):

1. Sign in to the Accountant Portal at https://my.fiskl.com/portal
2. Navigate to the invite section within the portal
3. Send an invitation to your Fiskl company account
4. Accept the invitation in your company's account
5. Repeat this process for additional companies you wish to manage

The Accountant Portal provides a centralized dashboard where you can oversee and manage multiple company accounts efficiently, making it an ideal solution for users who need to handle multiple businesses or client accounts.

Note: Remember that each company requires its own Fiskl subscription, as they are separate accounting entities. Multiple Brands within a single subscription are suitable for businesses that operate under different brand names but share the same financial entity.


### How do I change the email for my Fiskl account?

To change your account email:

1. Go to `User Settings`
1. Go to `Account Settings`
1. Here you can change your email, password or remove Google Authorization

### How do I set up another company?

Fiskl operates on a one company per account basis, but there are flexible options to manage multiple business identities within the platform.

- **Multiple Templates and Brands:** You can customize Multiple Templates and Brands within a single account to cater to different business needs. This feature allows you to maintain distinct branding and documentation for each entity under the same account.
- **Account Switching:** On Android and iOS, you can easily switch between different accounts without the need to sign in again. This feature simplifies managing multiple companies from a single device.
- **Accountant Portal:** If you manage multiple companies or clients, consider using the Accountant Portal for streamlined access and management across various accounts.

These options offer flexibility and convenience, ensuring you can manage multiple business operations efficiently within the Fiskl platform.
