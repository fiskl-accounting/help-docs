### Can I customize my invoice language?

Yes, you can clone and customize languages. Go to [Invoice and Quote Language](../Settings-Configurations/invoice-and-quote-settings.md#custom-language-cloning) settings, clone a language, and modify the values as needed.

### If I update my template, will it affect invoices already created?

Yes, updating a template affects all invoices using that template, including previous ones. To avoid this, create a new template and set it as default for future invoices. Learn more about [Templates & Brands](../Settings-Configurations/templates-and-brands.md).

### How do I edit invoices which have payments attached?

Change the invoice status to "Draft" or use the edit icon. Payments will be temporarily disabled but usually auto-restore on save. If not, you can manually restore them. See [Invoicing Management](../Core-Features/Invoicing/invoice-management.md) for details.

### Can I set my invoice to be automatically sent each month?

Yes, use [Recurring Invoices](../Core-Features/Invoicing/Recurring%20Invoices/creating-recurring-invoices.md). This feature allows you to set up invoices to be sent automatically at specified intervals, such as monthly or quarterly.

### Can I change the invoice number?

Yes, when creating an invoice. The new format becomes the default, and if it ends in a digit, it will increment automatically. For more control, see [Invoicing Management](../Core-Features/Invoicing/invoice-management).

### How can I show my VAT or Tax number on my invoice?

Yes, when creating an invoice. The new format becomes the default, and if it ends in a digit, it will increment automatically. For more control, see [Invoicing Management](../Core-Features/Invoicing/invoice-management).

### Can I create a receipt?

While there's no dedicated receipt feature, you can resend a paid invoice with a custom message. The customer will see the invoice marked as paid, the payment date, and can download the PDF. This is typically sufficient as a receipt of payment.
