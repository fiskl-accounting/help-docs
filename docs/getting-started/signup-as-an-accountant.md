# Sign up as an Accountant

Using the `Accounting Portal` in Fiskl you can manage your clients Fiskl accounts for which you have been given access to. 

If you would like create new Fiskl accounts on behalf of your clients then please reach out so that we can provide you with the required codes making onboarding of clients easier.

:::note
If you want Fiskl to bill you for your clients then you will need to speak to us and we will provide you with URL's for each package to more easly create accounts on your clients behalf.

## Steps for creating an account on behalf of your client

### Step 1

Create the client’s account using the custom Fiskl URL link tailored to the desired plan, using your client’s email address for account setup. E.g

https://my.fiskl.com/registration?code=specialcode\_solo

https://my.fiskl.com/registration?code=specialcode\_pro

https://my.fiskl.com/registration?code=specialcode\_prime.

:::note
Before you invite your clients, ensure that you receive your custom link from Fiskl with the associated discount as per your agreement with Fiskl and ensure that you specify the maximum number of clients you would like to configure for each plan for the next 12 months at a minimum. Clients numbers can be increased on request (up to 24h turnaround, except for week-ends).

For further details on setting up a Fiskl account, click [here](https://fiskl.com/help/getting-started/introduction/sign-up-for-fiskl/), ensuring you use your unique custom URL link rather than the generic one.

### Step 2

Your client will need to verify their email to be able to access their Fiskl account.

### Step 3

You will receive an email notifying you of your accountant access. Log in or register on the Accountant Portal and accept the notification displayed on your portal home page.

> If you've been using a trial account, delete that account before accepting the invitation as Fiskl allows a single email per login. Then, register for a new account using the same email address.

> You can find “Delete account” instructions [here](https://fiskl.com/help/plans-billing/account-management/delete-your-fiskl-account/).

### Step 5

**How does the billing process work?**

1. Billing Process: Fiskl will issue a monthly invoice to your accounting firm for all active clients and users, applying any agreed-upon discounts (as per agreement).
2. Deactivation Protocol: If a client discontinues service, the accountant must notify Fiskl to manually deactivate the account.
3. Visibility of Billing Information: Clients will not have access to the Subscriptions and billing page nor will they see any pricing details within the account.
4. Bank and Payment Integrations: Clients have the ability to connect their bank accounts and payment gateways to Fiskl (within account tier limits for bank connections).
5. Account Billing Modifications: Clients are restricted from changing their service plan (upgrading/downgrading). However, they can add additional users within the limit of their current account plan. Requests for more users can be accommodated upon request from the accountant.

**Notes:**

* An accountant can be invited to multiple companies with the same email as an accountant.
* A client cannot set up multiple companies with the same email address.
* If an accountant has used a Fiskl trial account as a Client, then they will need to delete the account so they can use the email as an accountant. [https://fiskl.com/help/delete-your-fiskl-account/](https://fiskl.com/help/delete-your-fiskl-account/)
