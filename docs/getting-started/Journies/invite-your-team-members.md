# Invite team members

Fiskl makes it easy to collaborate with your team. Here's how to invite and manage team members:

## Access team member management

1. Select "Team Members" from the left menu
2. You'll see a list of all your current team members, their roles, and their status (active, inactive, or pending)

At the top, you'll find three cards:
1. User stats (active, inactive, and accountant counts)
2. Invite new member
3. Invite accountant

## Invite a new team member

1. Click the "Invite new member" card
2. Enter the team member's information
3. Assign a role (see below for role descriptions)
4. Click "Send invite"

The new member will appear in your list with a "Pending" status until they accept the invitation.

## Team member roles

- **Owner:** Full access, including subscription and billing information
- **Admin:** Full access, excluding subscription and billing information
- **Billing user:** Can create invoices, quotes, and items; view all items; manage client list
- **User:** Can create and view their own items (expenses, mileage, time)

Remember, effective team management in Fiskl can streamline your workflow and ensure proper access control to your financial data.
