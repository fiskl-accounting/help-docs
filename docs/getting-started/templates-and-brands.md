# Templates and Brands

Templates & brands are a fantastic way to create various styled invoices, quotes and emails and to have multiple brands in one account.

## What is a Template?

A `template` is a representation of the style and content of your invoice, quote and emails. With templates, you can:

- Choose different invoice layouts
- Change various colours, fonts and what is displayed
- Change your logo and alter its size
- Add a logo for your email
- Add default attachments to always be included
- Create custom emails for each template

You can have multiple templates to suit different needs.

:::info[Note]
The email logo is only available on the default emails. If you choose custom emails they will be plain text without any HTML formatting.
:::

## What is a Brand?

A brand is a template but where you override your company details. This is particularly useful if you operate multiple brands under one accounting entity.

To configure your templates, visit [Template settings](https://sandbox.fiskl.ca/templates).

:::info[Warning]
Changing a template will affect previously sent invoices of that template. Consider creating a new template to prevent this.
:::

## Configure your template

You can configure your template to change its layout style, font, colours, attachments, logos for both the template and emails.
You can also change what values are visible on your invoices for example you can choose to display or hide quantity, FX rates, Units and more.


This is also where you can override the standard emails and create custom emails for

- Invoice
- Quote
- Deposit requested
- Partial payment
- Overdue reminders


<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0, width: '100%' }}>
  <iframe
    style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%', border: 0 }}
    src="https://demo.fiskl.com/e/clz9jx3mf0030l30d73gjxbhl/tour"
    allowFullScreen
    webkitallowfullscreen="true"
    mozallowfullscreen="true"
    allowtransparency="true"
  ></iframe>
</div>

## Create a brand using your template

A brand is just a template where the default company information is overridden.

When configuring your template there is a section called `Change brand for this template`.
Any values added to this section will override the values usually used in `Company settings`.

For example you can override the following values:

- Company name
- Email address
- Phone number
- Addres
- Invoice and Quote name

### Create a branded template

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0, width: '100%' }}>
  <iframe
    style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%', border: 0 }}
    src="https://demo.fiskl.com/share/clzazu9qj0007ie0c8f76kk8r/tour"
    allowFullScreen
    webkitallowfullscreen="true"
    mozallowfullscreen="true"
    allowtransparency="true"
