# Fiskl Style Guide

## A

### account
Lowercase unless referring to a specific product (e.g., Fiskl Account).

### accountant
Lowercase unless referring to a specific product (e.g., Fiskl Accountant Portal).

### accounting terms
When introducing an accounting term, define it first, then provide the technical term.

Example: "Include all of your debts, like loans and mortgages. In accounting, these are called liabilities."

### acronyms
Spell out on first use, followed by the acronym in parentheses. Use the acronym thereafter.

### AI
It's okay to use the acronym for Artificial Intelligence, but focus on benefits rather than the technology itself.

### app
Lowercase. Specify the name of the app when using this word.

Example: "The Fiskl mobile app helps you manage your business finances on the go."

### bank transfer
Use "bank transfer" when referring to moving funds between bank accounts. Be specific about any fees associated with different payment types.

### base currency
Use "base currency" when referring to the currency set on the Fiskl account company currency.

### business name
Use "business name" when referring to the customer's business or legal business name. Use "company name" for what the customer named their business inside Fiskl.

### can, can't
Use "can" instead of "allowed to" or "enabled." Use "can't" instead of "cannot" or "can not."

Use "select" insteadâ€”not everyone uses a mouse. Provide clear context for where a CTA will take the customer.

### data
Use "data" or "information" when discussing privacy or sensitive topics. "Info" is okay in less formal contexts.

### e-commerce
Lowercase unless it starts a sentence. Hyphenate.
