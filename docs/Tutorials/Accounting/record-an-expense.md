## Method 1: Record Expense and Reconcile in Accounting

Use this method when you want to:

- Capture detailed expense information (e.g., restaurant receipts with attendees and reasons)
- Use OCR to extract relevant details
- Allow team members to record expenses for later reconciliation by an admin

Important: Adding an expense this way is just a placeholder. It doesn't count towards accounting until you reconcile it.

Steps to record and reconcile an expense:

1. Record the expense:
   - Enter expense details
   - Attach supporting documents
   - Use OCR to extract information (if available)

2. Reconcile the expense:
   - Find the corresponding transaction in your Bank, Credit Card, or Cash account
   - Use the match functionality to link the recorded expense with the transaction

## Method 2: Pure Accounting

In most cases, you only need to record your expenses in your [Chart of Accounts](../../Core-Features/Accounting/chart-of-accounts.md). The goal is to work primarily from your [Money Accounts](/docs/Tutorials/Banking/how-to-import-bank#understanding-money-accounts-in-fiskl), which are the accounts where money flows into and out of your company.

Here's how to record expenses using this method:

1. Identify the appropriate Money Account:
   - Bank accounts: `Assets > Cash & Cash Equivalence > [Your Bank Name]`
   - Credit card accounts: `Liabilities > Credit Card > [Your Credit Card Name]`
   - Cash accounts: `Assets > Cash & Cash Equivalence > Cash on Hand`

1. Find the transaction in the selected Money Account

1. Categorize the transaction:
   - Assign the correct expense category (e.g., "Travel Expense")

1. Add supporting information (optional):
   - Attach documents (images, files)
   - Record detailed notes
   - Add client and vendor information
   - Include receipt numbers

Example:
If you paid for an airline ticket using your Chase bank account:

1. Navigate to `Assets > Cash & Cash Equivalence > Chase Bank`
1. Locate the transaction for the airline ticket
1. Categorize it as "Travel Expense"
1. Attach the receipt and add any relevant notes

Remember: Reconciliation is crucial to ensure the expense is properly accounted for in your financial records.

By following these methods, you can effectively manage and record your expenses in Fiskl, ensuring accurate and up-to-date financial records for your business.
