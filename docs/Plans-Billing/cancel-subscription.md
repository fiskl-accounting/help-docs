You can cancel your subscription at any time from within the Fiskl Dashboard.

## How to cancel your current subscription

If you would like to cancel your subscription but not delete your account, you can do this from the `Subscriptions & Billing` menu:

1. From the left menu, select `Subscriptions & Billing`
1. Choose the `Billing` tab
1. On your plan card, click the `X` to start the process of cancelling your subscription
1. Confirm the cancellation in the modal that appears

You have now cancelled your subscription renewal. On the plan card, you will see the date that your subscription will end.

:::tip
You can revert the cancellation at any time before your subscription ends.

## What happens when my subscription ends?

When your subscription ends:

- You will still have access to most of your data that is accessible on the `Free` plan. This mostly includes everything except accounting features.
- After several days, we will disconnect any automated banking feeds that you have through `Salt Edge` or `Yodlee`.
- There is no loss of data. If you decide to re-subscribe in the future, all of your data will be available, but you will most likely need to re-connect your banking.

## Can I delete my account?

Yes, you can fully delete your account and all related data. To find out more, see [How to delete my Fiskl account](./delete-account.md).
