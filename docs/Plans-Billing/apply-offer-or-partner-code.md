Fiskl provides introductory offers when you register. We also occasionally offer special partner codes with unique conditions or billing managed by the partner.

## How to apply offer codes

You can apply offer codes in three ways:

1. On the [Fiskl registration](https://my.fiskl.com/registration) page, select the "Have an offer code?" link in the top right
2. Use a special URL that automatically applies the offer (e.g., `https://my.fiskl.com/registration?code=your-offer`)
3. In user settings, go to the account settings tab and enter the code in the "Offer or Partner Code" field

## Important notes about offers

:::info
- Offers cannot be stacked
- If you received an offer at registration, you cannot apply another offer later
- Offers automatically expire after their set duration
- Some offers may be specific to certain regions or plans
:::

Remember: Fiskl's standard introductory offers are typically the best available. Partner codes are used for special circumstances and may have different terms.
