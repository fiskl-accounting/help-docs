4. Confirm your upgrade

### Downgrading

## User changes

This tab displays the history of users on your account. It shows when users joined and when they were removed from the team members page.

## Billing

This tab displays your current plan and the card you're using for subscription payments.

### Plan Card

The left card shows your current plan, price, any discounts, and the next billing date. The top right of the card has either an "X" or a round arrow icon:

- "X": Cancels your subscription at the end of the current period. You'll revert to the free plan with limited features.
- Round arrow icon: Appears if you've cancelled but are still in the current billing period. Selecting this will revert the cancellation.

### Saved card

Edit your card information here if it's expiring or you want to change payment methods.

Remember: Keeping your subscription and payment information up-to-date ensures uninterrupted access to Fiskl's features.
