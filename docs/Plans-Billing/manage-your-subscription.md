## Plans

In this tab, you can upgrade or downgrade your subscription.

### Upgrading Your Plan

You can upgrade your plan at any time if you're currently on the Free, Solo, or Pro plan. When upgrading, you'll be charged a pro-rata amount, and your new plan will take effect immediately.

To upgrade your plan:

1. Navigate to the pricing page and select the plan you wish to upgrade to.
1. Review the pricing details. (Note: Any free or discounted introductory offers will be honored.)
1. Click "Upgrade to [chosen plan]".
1. Confirm your selection to complete the upgrade process.

Your account will be instantly upgraded, and you'll have immediate access to the new features.

### Downgrading Your Plan

If you're currently on the Solo or Pro plan, you can downgrade to a lower-tier plan at any time.

To downgrade your plan:

1. Go to the pricing page and locate your current plan.
1. Find the plan you wish to downgrade to (the previous tier).
1. Click "Downgrade" in the column of your desired plan.
1. Review the changes and confirm your downgrade.

Please note: Your downgrade will take effect at the end of your current billing cycle. You'll continue to have access to your current plan's features until then.

:::tip
Before downgrading, review the features of each plan to ensure the lower-tier plan meets your business needs. Your downgrade will only take effect at the end of your current billing period. You can cancel the scheduled downgrade at any time before then.

## History

Use the date range filter to view your billing history. You can open invoices and download PDF versions using the print function.

:::info[tip]
If your tax number is set in `Company Settings`, it will appear on the invoice.

## User changes

This tab displays the history of users on your account. It shows when users joined and when they were removed from the team members page.

## Billing

This tab displays your current plan and the card you're using for subscription payments.

### Plan Card

The left card shows your current plan, price, any discounts, and the next billing date. The top right of the card has either an "X" or a round arrow icon:

- "X": Cancels your subscription at the end of the current period. You'll revert to the free plan with limited features.
- Round arrow icon: Appears if you've cancelled but are still in the current billing period. Selecting this will revert the cancellation.

### Saved card

Edit your card information here if it's expiring or you want to change payment methods.

Remember: Keeping your subscription and payment information up-to-date ensures uninterrupted access to Fiskl's features.
