The Tax Settings page allows you to set up and manage your sales taxes, non-sales taxes, tax groups, and tax identification numbers. Fiskl's flexible tax system supports multiple tax agencies in various currencies, accommodating single tax rates, multiple tax rates, and compound taxes.

Access Tax Settings using the `gear icon` on the top left menu or visit the [Manage Taxes page](https://my.fiskl.com/manage-taxes) on the web dashboard.

## Tax Configuration

The Manage Taxes screen consists of three main sections:

### 1. Single Taxes

In this section, you can:
- View a list of all your taxes and their assigned tax numbers
- Add new taxes and assign them to a Tax ID
- Designate taxes as either Sales or Non-Sales taxes
- Assign multiple taxes to a single Tax ID

The currency of the tax is determined by the associated Tax ID.

For example when creating French VAT tax, you would apply for a French VAT number and assign the appropriate VAT rate to that EUR Tax ID.

### 2. Tax Groups

Tax groups allow you to:
- Create collections of two or more taxes
- Set up compound (stacked) taxes

Example of a tax group:
> In British Columbia, the sales tax group includes both the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the Provincial Sales Tax (PST). These are applied together on sales transactions, with each tax having its own rate and rules but grouped for calculation and reporting purposes.

Example of a compound tax:
> In British Columbia, Canada:
> 1. Provincial Sales Tax (PST) is applied to the base price of an item.
> 2. Goods and Services Tax (GST) is then calculated on the total of the base price plus the PST.

### 3. Tax ID/VAT Numbers

In this section, you can manage your Tax IDs (also referred to as Tax Agency numbers). Each Tax ID is associated with:
1. Country
2. Currency
3. Specific taxes
