## Managing Team Members

### Inviting a New Team Member

1. From the left menu, select "Team members"
2. Click on "Invite new member"
3. Enter the team member's information:
   - Name
   - Email address
4. Assign a role
5. Click "Send invite"

The new member will appear in your list with a "Pending" status until they accept the invitation and log into Fiskl.

### Changing User Roles

1. Go to the Team Members page
2. Find the team member in the list
3. Click on their current role
4. Select the new role from the dropdown menu

The user's access levels will automatically be updated.

### Deactivating a User

1. Locate the user in the team member list
2. Switch the toggle next to their name to the off position

The user will remain on the list but will be inactive until reactivated.

### Reactivating a User

1. Find the deactivated user in the list
2. Switch the toggle back to the on position

### Deleting a Team Member

1. Deactivate the user first
2. Click the delete button that appears next to their name

## Best Practices for Team Management

1. Regularly review team member roles and permissions
2. Assign the least privileged role necessary for each team member's responsibilities
3. Promptly deactivate or delete accounts for team members who leave your organization
4. Educate your team on the importance of maintaining the security of their Fiskl login credentials

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while managing your team:

1. Ensure you have owner or admin rights to make changes
2. Check that the email address for new invitations is correct
3. If a user can't access certain features, verify their assigned role and permissions

For persistent issues, contact Fiskl support for assistance.
