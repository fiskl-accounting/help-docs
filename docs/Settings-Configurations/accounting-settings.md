The Accounting Settings page allows you to configure your accounting preferences and default accounts in Fiskl. These settings ensure accurate financial reporting and streamline your bookkeeping process.

Access Accounting Settings using the `gear icon` on the top left menu or visit the [Accounting Settings page](https://my.fiskl.com/accounting-settings) on the web dashboard.

## Accounting Settings

- **Company Currency**: Displays your base currency. This cannot be changed after account creation.

- **Fiscal Year End**: Set your company's fiscal year end date. This affects date periods in filters, such as:
  - This year / Last year
  - This financial year
  - This quarter / Last quarter
  - This financial quarter

- **Accounting Method**: Choose between Cash or Accrual accounting. 
  - Cash: Income and expenses are recorded when money changes hands.
  - Accrual: Income and expenses are recorded when they're earned or incurred.

Changing your accounting method can significantly impact your financial reports. However, Fiskl offers unique flexibility:

This setting only determines the default view for your reports.
Unlike other platforms, Fiskl allows you to switch between Cash and Accrual without affecting your underlying data.
You can start with Cash accounting and later switch to Accrual (or vice versa) at any time.
Fiskl enables you to generate reports in both Cash and Accrual methods, regardless of your default setting.

This flexibility allows you to adapt your accounting view as your business needs evolve, without the need for data migration or reorganization.

## Default Income Accounts

Set default ledger accounts for various income types to automate your bookkeeping:

- **Products**: Default account for product sales (e.g., "Sales of Products")
- **Services**: Default account for service income
- **Time**: Default account for billable time
- **Mileage**: Default account for mileage charges (e.g., "Sales Others")
- **Billable Expenses**: Default account for reimbursable expenses

:::info[tip]
You can override these defaults when creating individual items or during transactions.
