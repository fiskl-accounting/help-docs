The `Accounting Settings` page allows you to configure your accounting preferences and standard accounts in Fiskl. These settings ensure accurate financial reporting and streamline your bookkeeping process.

Access `Accounting Settings` using the `gear icon` on the top left menu or visit the [Accounting settings page](https://my.fiskl.com/accounting-settings) on the web dashboard.

## Accounting settings

- **Company currency**: Displays your base currency. This cannot be changed after account creation.

- **Fiscal year end**: Set your company's fiscal year end date. This affects date periods in filters, such as:
  - This year / Last year
  - This financial year
  - This quarter / Last quarter
  - This financial quarter

- **Accounting method**: Choose between Cash or Accrual accounting
  - Cash: Income and expenses are recorded when money changes hands
  - Accrual: Income and expenses are recorded when they're earned or incurred

Changing your accounting method can significantly impact your financial reports. However, Fiskl offers unique flexibility:

- This setting determines the initial view for your reports
- Unlike other platforms, Fiskl allows you to switch between Cash and Accrual without affecting your underlying data
- You can start with Cash accounting and later switch to Accrual (or vice versa) at any time
- Fiskl enables you to generate reports in both Cash and Accrual methods, regardless of your chosen setting

This flexibility allows you to adapt your accounting view as your business needs evolve, without the need for data migration or reorganization

## Standard income accounts

Set standard ledger accounts for various income types to automate your bookkeeping:

- **Products**: Standard account for product sales (e.g., "Sales of Products")
- **Services**: Standard account for service income
- **Time**: Standard account for billable time
- **Mileage**: Standard account for mileage charges (e.g., "Sales Others")
- **Billable expenses**: Standard account for reimbursable expenses

:::info[tip]
You can override these standard accounts when creating individual items or during transactions.
