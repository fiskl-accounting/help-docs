Access Company Settings using the `gear icon` on the top left menu or visit the [Company Settings](https://my.fiskl.com/company-settings) page on the web dashboard.

- **Currency**: Your base company currency (can't be changed after account creation).

## Time Name Template

Create a template for all recorded time entries. A descriptive line item name can be useful when billing a client via an invoice.

Example template:
```
[hours]:[minutes] on [date_short][time] - [client_name]
```

This template will result in a time name like: `03:00 on 6/8/24 1:34 pm - SG-Client`
