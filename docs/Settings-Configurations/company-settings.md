The `Company Settings` page allows you to manage your basic company information in Fiskl. This information is used across various features to ensure accurate reporting and invoicing.

Access Company settings using the `gear icon` on the top left menu or visit the [Company settings page](https://my.fiskl.com/company-settings) on the web dashboard.

## General

Most values in `Company Settings` can be overridden by a brand in [Templates and brands](./templates-and-brands).

- **Company name**: Your official name for invoices, quotes, and reports
- **Industry**: Helps Fiskl provide relevant features and reports
- **Email**: Used for important account notifications
- **Phone**: Your main business contact number for invoices, quotes, and reports
- **ID/Registration no.**: Often required on invoices in many countries
- **Currency**: Your base company currency (can't be changed after account creation)
- **Time zone**: Ensures all Fiskl timestamps, notifications, and recurring invoices align with your local time
- **Logo**: Used on your invoices, quotes, and reports

## Address

:::info[tip]

## Time name template

Create a template for all recorded time entries. A descriptive line item name can be useful when billing a client via an invoice.

Example template:
```
[hours]:[minutes] on [date_short][time] - [client_name]
```

This template will result in a time name like: `03:00 on 6/8/24 1:34 pm - SG-Client`
